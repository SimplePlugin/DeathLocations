# What is this plugin?
Simplistic plugin that sends you a message with your death location.

The current version of the plugin was intentionally kept simple to reduce the likelihood of it breaking between different Minecraft versions.

- Download the jar file.
- Place the file into your server's plugin folder.
- Start the server and Enjoy!
